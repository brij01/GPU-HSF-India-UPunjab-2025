## Notebooks

Each module contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with explanations, code samples, and exercises. Topics include:

- CUDA programming basics
- Memory management (device, unified memory)
- Parallel algorithms (vector/matrix operations, heat conduction)
- Streaming and concurrency
- Profiling and performance analysis
- HEP event generation and analysis
- Neural network demos


## Scripts

- [`07/verify_notebook.py`](07/verify_notebook.py):  
  Analyze notebook structure, extract code cells to files, and report statistics on content and coverage.

## Credits

- The heat conduction CPU source code in `01/AC_CUDA_C.ipynb` is credited to [An OpenACC Example Code for a C-based heat conduction code](http://docplayer.net/30411068-An-openacc-example-code-for-a-c-based-heat-conduction-code.html) from the University of Houston.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow the step-by-step exercises in each module.
4. Use the verification script to analyze or extract code from notebooks:
     ```sh
     python 08/verify_notebook.py <notebook_path>
     ```
